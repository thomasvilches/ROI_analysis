# COVID-19 Agent Based Model for ROI Analysis

The features and instruction will be added later when the code is ready.

## To Do list

- Implementing three vaccines and the number of doses distribution.
- Calculate the total years of work that are lost in each simulation.
- Organize the output of the model.
- Should we use *lat* of *sev* and *symp*? Pros and Cons...
- Organize incidence data.



## New York City data in Nov 2021

The branch `NYC` has data for NYC and the model is calibrated. 

- Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were implemented. We are ignoring Gamma and Beta.
- New age groups according to NYC vaccination data.
- Jensen was implemented. We need to set up the vaccine efficacy against variants.
- This commit is before a huge change in the vaccination process. The change will be necessary to get the right proportion of given vaccines.
